# Biomedical_project
This is a project in an IPython Notebook for Biomedical Research on Atorvastatin therapy in patients with Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) and High Risk for Conversion to Multiple Sclerosis (MS):

The goal of this repository is to test the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin. According to study patients are divided into placebo and atorvastatin group. Patients meeting certain conditions(at least two silent ovoid T2 bright areas in the deep white matter)are evaluated based on median cumulative number of new T2 and gadolinium enhanced lesions, changes in T1 or T2 lesion volumes. The study participants was evaluated at baseline, months 1, 2 and 3, and then every 3 months by physical examinations, adverse event assessment, EDSS, MSFC, and MRI scans. In addition, concomitant medications was recorded those who meet the primary endpoint was offered the standard of care for MS (interferon β-1a, Avonex), and remained in the study and continue to receive atorvastatin or placebo.
